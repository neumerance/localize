Tried. It didn't work. I got the following message: "Could not delete
project on the server. Revision cannot be deleted now."

Also, how do I delete projects from the server web site that don't
appear in TA Project Manager?

Thanks!

Dear Leonard Porrello,

A support person replied to your ticket.

--------------------
I added a 'delete' button to projects. It appears for projects that are
hidden and with no translator communication.

Can you try deleting these projects?
