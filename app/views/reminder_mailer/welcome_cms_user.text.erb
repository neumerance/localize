Dear <%= @user.full_real_name %>,

Thank you for creating an account in ICanLocalize.

== Next steps for translating your site ==

1. Send documents for translation.
2. Choose translators.
3. Deposit payment for the translation.

You can do all the above from you website. Log in and go to '<%= @control_screen %>'.

Note: you only need to choose translators once. When you send more documents to translation, they would be translated by the same translators that you choose now.

You can access your ICanLocalize account here:
<%= url_for({:escape => false, :only_path => false, :controller=>:login, :action=>:index, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL } ) %>

To log in, use your email (<%= @user.email %>) and this password:
<%= @user.password %>

== Need help? ==

If you have any questions or need help, let us know. You can open a support ticket directly from your website, from '<%= @control_screen %>', or using this link:
<%= url_for({:escape => false, :only_path => false, :controller=>:support, :action=>:new, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL } ) %>
