Dear <%=@client.fname%>,

We would like to thank you for using our services and being a loyal ICanLocalize customer.

In this spirit of mutual collaboration, we have designed a logo that we were hoping you would be willing to feature on your website or your app page on your preferred Store.

At a glance your users will see that we are responsible for the quality of the translation in your site or app, and that you went the extra length to address the different markets in their native language.
In addition, you can hyperlink this logo to your own affiliate link and start earning affiliate commissions as well as adding a link in your application About box.

The logo files are attached to this e-mail. Please feel free to use it. If you choose to add it, please email us at hello@icanlocalize.com with the URL link to where itâ€™s shown.

We look forward to hearing from you,


Laura de Figueiredo,
Human Resources Manager and COO
