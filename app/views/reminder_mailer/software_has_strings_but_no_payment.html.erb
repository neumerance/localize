Dear <%= @client.full_real_name %>,

Thank you for creating your first software project.

I can see you already sent the strings to your translators. Do you need some help to process the pending payment? Translators won’t have access to the strings until payment is made.

The payment box should be visible at the top of the <%= link_to text_resource_url(@project) %>'s project page.

Please, let me know if you need some help. I’ll be happy to assist.

Kind regards,
