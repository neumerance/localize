Dear <%= @user.full_real_name %>,

A visitor has left feedback about your translation:

---

<%= @feedback.txt %>

---

<% if @job_url %>This feedback concerns the following job:
<%= url_for(@job_url.merge({:escape => false, :only_path => false, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL }) ) %><% end %>

You can respond to the feedback directly here:
<%= url_for({:escape => false, :only_path => false, :controller=>:feedbacks, :action=>:show, :id=>@feedback.id, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL } ) %>

A quick note from us:

Feedback is great. It allows visitors to tell us what they think, make suggestions and corrections.

Sometimes, visitor feedback can help catch typos and point out better terminology. In other times, visitor suggestions may not be correct.
Ultimately, you are responsible for the translation and not visitors. Please make the best use of visitor feedback and remember it comes with good intentions.
