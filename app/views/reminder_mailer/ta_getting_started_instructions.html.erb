2.1) Creating a project
Click on the button labeled 'Create a new project'. A wizard will guide you through the steps required for creating a new translation project.

2.2) Upload and complete project setup
In order for translators to be able to see your project and bid on it, you must first upload the project to the website. To do this, click on the button labeled 'Upload project'.
Translation Assistant will then send your project to the website. Then, you'll have to complete the project setup by filling out important information.

2.3) Releasing the project
Once you complete your project setup, you need to release it, so that translators may be able to see it. Click on 'Release project'. If your project setup is complete your project will be released. Otherwise, you'll be pointed to missing information which needs to be filled in.

2.4) Getting bids
After your project has been released, translators are able to bid on it. You may communicate with translators, to iron out any details.

2.5) Selecting a translator
When you're happy with a bid, you may accept it. After you make your escrow deposit, for the project payment, the translator will start to work on your project.


3) During the work
Whenever the translator makes an update to your projects and uploads it, this update automatically appears in Translation Assistant. You can click on 'Edit' to view the current status of the project.

3.1) Generating the translated website
At any moment, you may generate the translated website. To do this, click on 'Write translated website' from Translation Assistant.
Whenever you generate the website, the recent translation is used. You are encouraged to repeat this step when the translator sends you work for review, in order to see the complete website in a browser and make sure that you're happy with the results.

3.2) Work complete
Once the translator completes work on your project, you'll see the status update to '100% complete'. You should review the work, and when you're happy with it, accept the work as complete.
This will release the project funds to the translator.

3.3) Uploading your translated website to your server
When you generate the translated website, Translation Assistant creates your complete website, including language controls. You need to upload the entire contents of the folder where you generated your website to your server.
