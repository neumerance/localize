Dear <%= @user.full_real_name %>,

Your Instant Translation is still not complete. At this point, you can keep waiting for translators to do this work or cancel the translation and withdraw your funds.

If you want to keep waiting, no further action is required. Our system will keep reminding translators about this work until it's done.

To cancel the work and withdraw the payment back to your PayPal account, follow these steps:

1) Go to your list of Instant Translation projects:
<%= url_for({:escape=>false, :only_path=>false, :controller=>:web_messages, :action=>:index, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL } ) %>

2) Click on the message you wish to cancel.

3) Click on the button 'Delete this project'.

4) Once you've deleted all Instant Translation projects you wish to cancel, go to 'My Account'->'Deposits and payments' and click on 'Withdraw money from this account'.
We will transfer the payment back to your PayPal account (you will not be charged any fee from us or from PayPal).

If you need any help, open a support ticket:
<%= url_for({:escape=>false, :only_path=>false, :controller=>:support, :action=>:new, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL } ) %>
* Don't reply to this email. This inbox is not monitored for replies.

We'd like to apologize for the delay and for any inconvenience this must have caused you. We're working on improving the responsiveness of our translators in these languages.
