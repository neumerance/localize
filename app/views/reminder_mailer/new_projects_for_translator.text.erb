<% if @missing_categories.length > 0 %>=== Categories of Expertise ===
	Clients look for translator based on their fields of expertise. The project(s) above require fields that you don't have, or didn't indicate in your profile:
	<%= (@missing_categories.collect { |c| "* #{c.name}" }).join("\n") %>

	If you have experience translating in these fields, add them to your profile page:
	<%= url_for({:escape => false, :only_path => false, :host=>EMAIL_LINK_HOST, :protocol=>EMAIL_LINK_PROTOCOL, :controller=>:users, :action=>:show, :id=>@user.id, :anchor=>'categories'}) %>
