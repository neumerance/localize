Dear <%= @client.full_real_name %>,

Thank you for creating your first software project.

I can see you already selected your translators and you are ready to get started!

The only step left is sending the strings to translations. Go back to <%= @project.name %>, check the green box of the language you want to send the strings for and click the ‘Begin marked translations’ button. 

If you get stuck, please, let me know and I’ll be happy to help.

Kind regards,
