            <source><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Belt Technologies, Inc. has been contacted by several customers specializing in manufacturing advanced vacuum deposition equipment. The machinery they develop is typically used to deposit micrometer- to nanometer-thin, functional coatings on materials such as glass, metal strips, wafers, and polymer films. These materials are typically used in products like solar panels, architectural glass, and smartphone displays.</span><br class="xliff-newline" /><h2>Designing a Conveyor Belt for Micrometer and Nanometer Vapor Deposition</h2><br class="xliff-newline" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this particular application, the customers usually seek a series of belts, pulleys, and timing elements. The belts are to be run in pairs, carrying a product to a high-vacuum chamber for a vapor deposition process.</span><br class="xliff-newline" /><br class="xliff-newline" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vapor deposition is a precise process used to coat products with a layer of material. These coatings are often extremely thin; the vapor deposition process can be used to deposit the material atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule. It is typically used for coating exceptionally sensitive materials and equipment. To be successful, the vapor deposition process requires a high-vacuum environment with zero risk of contamination.</span><br class="xliff-newline" /><h2>No Room for Error: Stainless Steel Is Clean, Precise and Reliable</h2><br class="xliff-newline" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the material reaches the vacuum chamber and the chamber is closed, there is no room for adjustment if the belt tracks off course or the material shifts in transit. Therefore, it is necessary that the motion profile of the belt be reliably precise. The belts also have to be exceptionally clean in order to prevent contamination. Anything that could potentially cause a delay in production, such as belt realignment, maintenance, or decontamination would cost up to several thousand dollars an hour in lost production time.</span><br class="xliff-newline" /><br class="xliff-newline" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stainless steel is an ideal material choice for applications requiring cleanliness and accuracy. Metal belts made of stainless steel do not require lubrication, do not outgas, and do not generate particulates.
